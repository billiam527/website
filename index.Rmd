My name is Bill. I am a fraud analyst and currently going for my master's degree at Mercyhurst University in the field of Data Science.  Here are some notes on R and dplyr.

## Filtering Columns and Rows

When using dplyr, you can filter columns and rows by using select and filter. Let's look at an example using the Lahman Baseball Database. We first have to load the Lahman and dplyr packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 New York Yankees. We could run the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & yearID==1927)
```

Let us look at some more examples.  Say we want to see which New York Yankee players hit more than 40 home runs in a year. We can run the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & HR>=40)
```

How about we look at which players, in the entire MLB, were able to hit 40 home runs while striking out less than 60 times.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO)%>%
  filter(HR>40 & SO<60)
```

Let us look at which Phillies players were abble to hit more than 30 home runs in the 1970s.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>30 & teamID=='PHI' & yearID>=1970 & yearID<=1979)
```

##Sorting

We can also sort our columns once we have our selected data filtered down.  To do this, we simply have to add an 'arrange' line into our code.

If we wanted to see a list of players who have hit more than 50 home runs in a year and also wanted that list to be sorted from the most home runs to the least, we would use the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

*Notice the 'desc' command before the category we want to sort.  This sorts it from largest to smallest.

If we wanted to see players who have had less than 10 strikeouts in a year (with a minimum of 400 at-bats) and sort by the lowest, we can use the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,AB,SO)%>%
  filter(AB>=400 & SO<10)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

##Aggregation

How about we work on some aggregation now?

If we have a certain player, we now know how to pull up all their homeruns in each of their seasons, but what if we want to see their homerun totals over a career? To do this we will use the 'group_by' and 'summarize' functions.  Here is an example taking Babe Ruth's HR total:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  filter(playerID=='ruthba01')%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR))
```

*Note that we created a variable for career homeruns (career_HR) so that we can refer to it later.

Now, what if we wanted to look at all players who hit more than 600 homeruns? We can run the following code:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR))%>%
  filter(career_HR>=600)%>%
  arrange(desc(career_HR))
```

If we wanted to look at players with the highest career averages we can run this code:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HRavg=mean(HR))%>%
  filter(career_HRavg>=30)%>%
  arrange(desc(career_HRavg))
```

This gives us the list of 13 players who were able to average more than 30 HRs in a season.

Finally, lets find all the players, since the 1970 season, that were able to hit 50 homeruns in a season at least once.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(yearID>1970)%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(fiftyclub=max(HR))%>%
  filter(fiftyclub>50)%>%
  select(playerID)
```

We will do this by first filtering for years that are greater than 1970.  Then we will group these by the player's IDs.  Next, you will need to find t a particular player's highest HR total in a season (because if they have never hit 50 in their career obviously, they would not make the list).  finally, since we do not necessarily need to see their HR totals we can ask to just see the player's names.
